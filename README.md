This is just some (as far as I can tell) unmodified code I found on my harddrive, which is apparently the original BSD 4.3 `as` assembler. 

It of course doesn't build on x86, and I'm assuming it's license is BSD 2 or 3 clause, but I can't guarantee that. 

I believe this should come from http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.3BSD/usr/src/bin/as however, I think git and github provides a bit better of an interface :)
